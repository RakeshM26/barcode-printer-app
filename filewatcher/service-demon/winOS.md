To make the bash script work on a Windows OS, you can use a tool like Git Bash, Cygwin, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). These tools provide a Unix-like environment on Windows, allowing you to run bash scripts.

### Using Git Bash or Cygwin

1. **Install Git Bash or Cygwin**:
   - [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/): Download and install Git for Windows, which includes Git Bash.
   - [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/): Download and install Cygwin.

2. **Modify the Script for Windows Paths**:
   - Update the paths in the script to use Windows-style paths or Cygwin-style paths.

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Open Git Bash or Cygwin and run the script.

### Using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

1. **Install WSL**:
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following command to install WSL and a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu):
     ```powershell
     wsl --install
     ```

2. **Modify the Script for WSL**:
   - Update the paths in the script to use WSL paths.

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Open the WSL terminal and run the script.

### Example Script for WSL

Here is an example of how you can modify the script to work with WSL:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Directory to monitor (use WSL path)
MONITOR_DIR="/mnt/c/path/to/your/folder"

# Printer name (use Windows printer name)
PRINTER_NAME="Bar-Code-Printer-TT065-50"

# Loop through all .prn files in the directory
for file in "$MONITOR_DIR"/*.prn; do
  if [ -e "$file" ]; then
    # Print the file
    lp -d "$PRINTER_NAME" -o raw "$file"
    # Optionally, move the file to a processed directory or delete it
    # mv "$file" /mnt/c/path/to/processed/folder/
    rm "$file"
  fi
done
```

### Setting Up a Scheduled Task on Windows

Instead of using cron, you can use Task Scheduler on Windows to run the script at regular intervals.

1. **Create a Batch File**:
   - Create a batch file (`print_prn_files.bat`) to run the bash script using WSL:
     ```batch
     @echo off
     wsl /path/to/print_prn_files.sh
     ```

2. **Set Up a Scheduled Task**:
   - Open Task Scheduler and create a new task.
   - Set the trigger to run the task at your desired interval (e.g., every minute).
   - Set the action to run the batch file (`print_prn_files.bat`).

### Full Example

1. **Create the Bash Script**:
   - Save the following script as `print_prn_files.sh`:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash

     # Directory to monitor (use WSL path)
     MONITOR_DIR="/mnt/c/path/to/your/folder"

     # Printer name (use Windows printer name)
     PRINTER_NAME="Bar-Code-Printer-TT065-50"

     # Loop through all .prn files in the directory
     for file in "$MONITOR_DIR"/*.prn; do
       if [ -e "$file" ]; then
         # Print the file
         lp -d "$PRINTER_NAME" -o raw "$file"
         # Optionally, move the file to a processed directory or delete it
         # mv "$file" /mnt/c/path/to/processed/folder/
         rm "$file"
       fi
     done
     ```

2. **Create the Batch File**:
   - Save the following as `print_prn_files.bat`:
     ```batch
     @echo off
     wsl /path/to/print_prn_files.sh
     ```

3. **Set Up the Scheduled Task**:
   - Open Task Scheduler and create a new task.
   - Set the trigger to run the task every minute.
   - Set the action to run `print_prn_files.bat`.

This setup will allow you to monitor a directory for `.prn` files and print them on a Windows OS using WSL.
